Define number of video streams, 5 is recommended max number. 
As an example value is 2. Both streams are using the same demo rtsp stream source

```text 
Number of video streams (^C to interrupt):
2
```

```text 
RTSP url address for video stream number 1:
rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov
```
```text 
RTSP url address for video stream number 2:
rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov
```

### Step 4:  Verify installation

Check that configuration files are created accordingly.

#### docker-compose.yml

```text 
more docker-compose.yml
```
- Check that file looks as proper docker-compose yaml file
- 1 Container per stream is created. Check that number of containers are matching with your setup

#### Video inbound configuration

```text 
ls ./nscIotConfig
```
Check that 
- each of the streams do have own dedicated configuration file.
- rtsp URL is created accordingly 
e.g 

```text 
more ./nscIotConfig/iotservice.properties1
```
as example output
```text 
more ./nscIotConfig/iotservice.properties1
```
